To open you have to:
1- Access to the folder "Semana-03".

### Week 02
In week 2 we made the html code of our project based on the model we previously made in FIGMA.

### Week 03
This week we implemented CSS to our html file and styled it differently. That way we generate a much nicer look and feel.

### Week 04
This week, we continue working on our html base and with the application of styles. This time we made our page responsive. We also created Github Pages to visualize our project.
