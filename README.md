### Week 02
In week 2 we made the html code of our project based on the model we previously made in FIGMA.

### Week 03
This week we implemented CSS to our html file and styled it differently. That way we generate a much nicer look and feel.

### Week 04
This week, we continue working on our html base and with the application of styles. This time we made our page responsive. We also created Github Pages to visualize our project.

Week 07 consists of extending the forms of week 06 so that when the confirmation buttons are pressed, the data loaded in them are sent to a web server by means of an HTTP request from JavaScript.
In the request the form data are sent as "query-params".
